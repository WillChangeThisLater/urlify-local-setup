### Usage

```bash
urlify file1 file2 ...
```

This utility takes local files, uploads them to S3,
and returns presigned URLs for each of the local
files uploaded.

The main purpose of this tool is to expose image files
living on the local system so an LLM can see them.

```bash
echo "What types of flowers are in these pictures?" | lm --imageURLs "$(urlify --output csv flowers/*jpeg)"
```


### Details
Images are uploaded to a S3 bucket.

The S3 bucket is set up with a lifecycle rule that deletes images
uploaded to the bucket after 1 day.

The URLs generated by urlify use presigned URLs that are valid
for up to 30 minutes.


### Testing
I need to write Go tests for this code.

I opted to take a stab at testing this code with Bash.
Basically the idea is to use bash to call `urlify` and
make sure its output looks like I intend it to.

The tests are currently broken. Eventually I want
to test the following:

  - I want to make sure basic usage works
  - I want to make sure command substitution works
  - I want to make sure the command works when multiple files are provided on the CLI
  - I want to make sure the command output options work
